Terminal based audio player for Node.js. Ultimate objective is to write
a tool for queuing up songs from across multiple playlists while keeping
track of which songs have been played and how much playtime remains in
the queue.

Still mainly in the hacking phase, some of the architecture has come
from poring over the [Decibel](https://github.com/scttnlsn/decibel)
project for insights.

A few alterations were made to [Blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed)
as well, to accomodate how I preferred to use list boxes.
